## ⚡ The "Field Test" Pitch (3-4 Minutes)

**Context:** You are running a **simulated drilling run** to show the system's adaptability over time.

---

### **1. THE SETUP (30 Seconds)**
**What to say:**
> "Since we can't drill into the floor here, I've prepared a **Field Test Simulation**.
> 
> I'm going to run a 30-second automated sequence that simulates a drill going from **0 to 30 meters deep**, hitting different layers of rock.
> 
> Watch how the AI adapts in real-time."

### **2. THE DEMO (Click "▶ Run Field Test Sequence")**

**0:00 - 0:05 (Starts)**
*   *Drill starts turning...*
*   **Say:** "Okay, starting the drill. We are hitting topsoil and soft coal first."

**0:05 - 0:10 (Coal Detected)**
*   *Screen shows COAL, Low RPM*
*   **Say:** "See that? It detected **Soft Coal**. It keeps the RPM low (450) to save fuel. No need to waste power here."

**0:10 - 0:15 (Limestone Transition)**
*   *Screen switches to LIMESTONE*
*   **Say:** "Now we're going deeper. The rock is getting harder. The system automatically bumped the speed to **850 RPM**."

**0:15 - 0:20 (Copper Found!)**
*   *Screen flashes COPPER*
*   **Say:** "Wait - look at that. It just flagged a **Copper Deposit**. This is huge for mining exploration. It maps the ore body while drilling."

**0:20 - 0:30 (Hard Rock Impact)**
*   *Screen alerts GRANITE (Orange/Red)*
*   **Say:** "And now we hit bedrock. Hard Granite.
    *   Vibration spiked.
    *   The AI instantly reacted.
    *   **RPM boosted to maximum** to punch through without stalling."

### **3. THE CLOSE (30 Seconds)**
**What to say:**
> "That was a perfect run.
> 
> In 30 seconds, the system optimized energy for soft rock, identified valuable copper, and protected the drill from hard granite.
> 
> This is what we mean by **Smart** Drilling."

**Tip:** You don't need to click anything else once you hit "Run Field Test". Just stand back and narrate like a sports commentator!
