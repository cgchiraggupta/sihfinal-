## 🎯 How to Explain to Judges

### **1. Hero Section (30 seconds)**
> "SmartDrill Pro is an AI-powered system that predicts rock types in real-time. 
> We achieve 94% accuracy, save 20-30% energy, and detect 13 different rock types in under 1 second."

### **2. Data Flow (1 minute)**
> "Watch the animated flow - sensors collect data, Arduino sends it to our Python API, 
> the ML model predicts the material, and everything is stored in the cloud. 
> This all happens in real-time as you drill."

### **3. Interactive Demo (2 minutes)**
> "Let me show you - I'll click 'Granite'... [click] 
> Watch as the system detects it, shows 94% confidence, recommends 2300 RPM, 
> and updates the live sensor charts. You can click any material to test it."

### **4. Material Database (1 minute)**
> "We support 13 different rock types - from soft Coal to hard Quartzite. 
> Each has optimal RPM settings. Click any material card to see it in action."

### **5. Energy Savings (30 seconds)**
> "By predicting materials before hitting them, we save 20-30% energy 
> compared to manual guessing. Faster detection means less trial and error."
